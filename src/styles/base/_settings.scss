  Hi, 

  First of all, if you have digged that deep in my code, thank you.
  If you have any feedback, you can reach me at aliyeverol98@gmail.com.

  This project is the clone of Parkside - https://www.parkside.at/en/home - website
  (at the date of 25 April 2018 for future visitors). However, content is changed as if it is my CV.
  
  Considering this website should like original website there is not consistency between values in CSS files,
  so I decided not to use variables. By this I mean, in order to make this clone as similar as possible with
  the original website visiually (without looking their code  for values), I have used different values for same
  kind of properties such as font-size, background-color etc. in different places. Should I used same values for same
  kind of properties in different places, it would be good decision to use variables. But, as I explained above it
  is not my case.

  However, there are some key features missing in this clone:
  1) Navbar is not same in mobile viewpoints. I have not implemented mobile-friendly navbar.
  2) Currently viewed site section is not highlighted in navbar or footer. This feature is not exactly same
  with original website since links in navbar in original website lead to different pages, but in my clone
  just different sections of page.
  3) I have not implemented indicators in carousel in clone, but there are in original.

  These are main differences in between two sites. There are some other little dissimilarities as well, but they are result of the content change and has been
  implemented for best user experience possible but are open for discussion for sure.

  The reason I have not implemented these 3 key features is I discovered this vacancy last Friday (today is Wednesday)
  and it has been posted 4 weeks ago so I thought I should code this clone in shortest time possible since this position can be
  filled any time soon.

  That is all for now. See you in next projects.

  P.S. I really do not expect to anyone ever read this comment but I had to write this comment to silence my developer
  conscience ;)

  Best,

  Erol
